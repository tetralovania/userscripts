### moodle
This is a Userscript *specifically* for the TU Dortmund moodle. It is exclusively made for 1920 x 1080 px screens. During testing, I did not find it to be misaligned/unusable/etc in smaller windows (although some stuff does break below 992px width, but since I never use moodle in a window as small as that, I really didn't care much about that).

If you find bugs, errors, whatever, or just want to improve something, feel free to open an issue and self-assign it :) You can open issues for things you don't want to fix yourself, but it might take a bit until I can get to it / finish it.
